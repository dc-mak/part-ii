\caption{Top 7 kinds of proof-objects in the OOT Coq library which are never
  used again (of which there are 107), grouped by module and ordered by
  frequency.  Module names (path property) have been shortened to remove
  redundant information. The ``stripped\_odd\_order\_theorem'' is a
  self-contained proof of the entire OOT relying only on basic Coq features and
  is not part of BG or PF. Many unused results are simply called `lemma'
  instead of the more descriptive and conventional `corollary' or
  `remark'.}\label{table:oot:unused}
