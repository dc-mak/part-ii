  Coq is an interactive proof-assistant~{\citep{Coq:manual}}; it allows users to
  formalise mathematical theories into machine-checked proofs. Coq libraries,
  which encode mathematical theories, are difficult to understand. In this
  dissertation, I will describe a new tool I implemented for Coq users that
  aimed to (a) represent Coq libraries as Neo4j (graph) databases and (b)
  provide a library of queries with the goal of highlighting the structure of
  and relationship between proof-objects. It achieves (b) by using
  network-analysis techniques usually associated with social-networks.

\section{Motivation}

Coq proof-scripts are notoriously difficult to understand. Not only do these
proof-scripts encode a mathematical theory, which can be difficult to
understand in and of itself, they serve as verbose instructions on how to
create proof-term whose type matches a certain proposition, rather than a
statement of \emph{why} something is true. There are currently no tools which
help with the challenge of gaining a \emph{high-level} understanding of a large
Coq library.

An example of a large Coq library is~{\citealt{gonthier2013oot}}. It translates
(into Coq) two dense books on the Feit-Thompson Odd Order Theorem
(\citealt{peterfalvi2000oot}, \citealt{bender1994oot}), which contain
thousands of proofs and definitions. It is part of a larger, general trend of
formalising substantial bodies of mathematics and marks the first time that we
have a new way representing mathematics, different from the usual combination
of formulas and natural-language prose.  Such a turning point provides an
opportunity to explore the novel representations and analyses possible.

However, it is still the case that when a user approaches a large Coq library, 
they are left to understand and keep track of several aspects of the
library (such as implicit assumptions, previously defined results and the
types and conventions behind any notation) by themselves. There is very little
opportunity to consider and compare different approaches for arriving at a
result (i.e.\ number of assumptions, number of steps, some notion of the
importance such as number of uses).

I obtained such an opportunity by using a query-based approach: by creating a
tool that expresses Coq libraries as databases. Then I was able query and
analyse them to gain insights like those mentioned above.

\section{A Database Approach}

Mathematical theories are highly interconnected structures of definitions and
proofs. As such, relational or a document-oriented models are not adequate
representations for answering questions such as `What depends on this lemma
and how many such things are there?' or `What are the components of this
definition?'.

Even a static, graph-based approach on its own is insufficient. Simply
outputting a dependency graph is ineffective for all but the smallest of
libraries. Figure~\ref{fig:static} shows one such dependency graph for a
medium-sized Coq library.

\begin{figure}[t]

  \caption{Static graph of \href{https://github.com/Timothy-G-Griffin/CAS}{CAS}
    Coq library. For all but the smallest of libraries, simply outputting a
    dependency graph is an ineffective way of understanding them. For example,
    if a user wanted to know whether or not X was used by Y, with a picture,
    they would have to visually trace backwards from Y to every node it depended
    on and check if X was one of them. In a relational database, such a query
    would not be possible with standard relational algebra (only with a
    highly-inefficient recursive-join); in a document database, a user would
    have to explicitly construct relations and joins at the application level.
    With graph databases, a user could simply enter a query (like the one in
    Table~\ref{table:oot:leadto}).}\label{fig:static}

\end{figure}

\emph{Graph databases} have been developed to deal with highly connected data
sets and path-oriented queries. That is, graph databases are optimised for
computing transitive-closure and related queries, which pose a huge challenge
for traditional, relational databases. Due to the emergence of massive data
sets thanks to large-scale social and advertising networks, new techniques for
representing and analysing such data have been developed.

For this project, I used the Neo4j~{\citep{neo4j}} graph database system (and its
expressive query language \emph{Cypher}) to create a tool for Coq users which
applies such network-analysis techniques to Coq libraries and help understand
them.

\section{Aims of this Project}\label{intro:aims}

In this project, I aimed to write a tool for Coq users that:

\begin{itemize}
\item represents Coq libraries as Neo4j graph databases. This involves
  \begin{itemize}
    \item exploring and choosing the correct model (schema)
  \item converting and extending existing code to output CSVs (comma-separated values)
  \item writing new programs to extract extra information \\
      (omitted from other, existing tools)
  \item writing new programs to automate database creation.
  \end{itemize}

\item provides a library of Neo4j queries, intended
  \begin{itemize}
  \item to highlight the structure of and relationship between proof-objects
  \item to provide several network-analysis techniques.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Note that the aims centre around the \emph{mechanics and details} of creating a
model for Coq proof-objects and applying network analysis techniques to it,
\emph{not creating a polished, user-friendly product}. Since \emph{usability was
not a focus of this project}, I did not conduct a user-study whilst evaluating
this tool.

\section{Sample of Coq}

For readers unfamiliar with Coq, the following small example will clarify the
starting point of this project.

\begin{minted}{coq}
(* A generic type-variable *)
Variable T : Set.

(* An inductive definition of a slist, similar to ML datatypes *)
Inductive slist : Set :=
| Empty : slist
| Sing : T -> slist
| Concat : slist -> slist -> slist.

(* Tranforming slists into regular by pattern matching. *)
Fixpoint flatten (xs : slist) : list T :=
  match xs with
  | Empty => nil
  | Sing x => cons x nil
  | Concat ys zs => flatten ys ++ flatten zs
  end.

(* We prove flatten distributes over concatenation. *)
Theorem flatten_dist_concat : forall ls1 ls2 : slist,
    flatten (Concat ls1 ls2) = flatten ls1 ++ flatten ls2.

\section{Summary}

First, I explained why Coq libraries are difficult to understand. Then, I said
that the trend of formalising large bodies of mathematics such as the
Feit-Thompson Odd Order Theorem~{(\citealt{peterfalvi2000oot}, \citealt{bender1994oot})}
presents an opportunity to develop new representations and analyses of
mathematical theories. After that, I outlined why databases, specifically
graph databases, were a promising approach to this new opportunity. Finally, I
listed the aims of this project.
