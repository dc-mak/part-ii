\chapter{Implementation}

{\sf \color{red}
  This chapter should describe what was actually produced: the programs which
  were written, the hardware which was built or the theory which was developed.
  Any design strategies that \textbf{looked ahead to the testing stage} might profitably
  be referred to (the professional approach again). 

  Descriptions of programs may include fragments of high-level code but large
  chunks of code are usually best left to appendices or omitted altogether.
  Analogous advice applies to circuit diagrams. 

  \textbf{Draw attention to the parts of the work which are not your own}. Making
  effective use of powerful tools and pre-existing code is often laudable, and
  will count to your credit if properly reported. 

  It should not be necessary to give a day-by-day account of the progress of the
  work but \textbf{major milestones may sometimes be highlighted with advantage}.

\section{Coq object-files to CSV}
\color{red}
I have so much to write!
For each: intention, execution, problems (remember the stack overflow), solutions.

Also, how it fit in with larger, open-source projects.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Conversion to CSV
  \item More precise kinds
  \item Recursive modules
  \item Types -- explain code, typechecking process
\end{itemize}
\color{black}

\section{Coq source-files to CSV}
\color{red}
Intention, execution, problems, solutions.

Also, how it fit in with larger, open-source projects.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Figuring out missing information
  \item Glob files -- explain
  \item Parsing glob file
  \item Matching up info later
\end{itemize}
\color{black}

\section{CSV to Neo4j}
\color{red}
Intention, execution, problems, solutions.

Also, how it fit in with larger, open-source projects.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The import tools
  \item Changes in the model, tradeoffs, impacts on execution.
\end{itemize}
\color{black}

\section{Query Library}
\color{red}
Intention, execution, problems, solutions.

Also, how it fit in with larger, open-source projects.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Figuring out what is missing
  \item Choosing what is feasible, efficient and useful.
  \item Explain algorithm (fancy maths)
  \item Visualisation tools
\end{itemize}
\color{black}

\section{Dead-ends and Lessons Learnt}
\color{red}
Coqdoc, multiple relationship types, attempting to parse.
