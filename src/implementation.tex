\chapter{Implementation}

\guidance{%
  This chapter should describe what was actually produced: the programs which
  were written, the hardware which was built or the theory which was developed.
	Any design strategies that \textbf{looked ahead to the testing stage} might
	profitably be referred to (the professional approach again). 

  Descriptions of programs may include fragments of high-level code but large
  chunks of code are usually best left to appendices or omitted altogether.
  Analogous advice applies to circuit diagrams. 

  \textbf{Draw attention to the parts of the work which are not your own}. Making
  effective use of powerful tools and pre-existing code is often laudable, and
  will count to your credit if properly reported. 

  It should not be necessary to give a day-by-day account of the progress of the
  work but \textbf{major milestones may sometimes be highlighted with advantage}.

	Upon completion of the project's plan, its execution commenced. What
	follows is an account of the programs written, problems encountered, solutions
	implemented and tests conducted using the project-structure shown in
	Figure~\ref{fig:structure} as a guide. \emph{Reasons} for design decisions
	(arrived at using \emph{formative} evaluation techniques) are detailed in the

\section{Coq object-files to CSV}

This section of implementation corresponds to ``dpdgraph++'' on
Figure~\ref{fig:structure}: modelling the data contained in and the structure
of Coq object-files (\texttt{*.vo}) as comma-separated values (CSVs). The
initial model (inherited from the open-source ``dpdgraph'' tool) and subsequent
changes to it will be described.

\subsection{Modelling}

Initially, each edge was assigned a \emph{weight} representing the number of
(directed) uses of one node by another. Each node was assigned four
\emph{properties}: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{body}, a boolean representing whether a global declaration was
    either transparent or opaque;
  
  \item \emph{kind}, a ternary value representing whether a \emph{global
    reference} (a kernel side type for all references) was a reference to either
    the environment, an inductive type a constructor of an inductive type;

  \item \emph{prop}, a boolean value representing whether a term is a \texttt{Prop}
    (a decidable, logical property about a program, as opposed to a
    \texttt{Type});

  \item \emph{path}, a string value represent the module an object is in.
\end{itemize}

These ``properties'' were difficult to understand: they are not in the
vocabulary of a Coq programmer (e.g. \texttt{Definition}, \texttt{Inductive},
\texttt{Theorem}) and could not represent the richness of the
AST appropriately. It was not documented how to translate these constructs back
to familiar terms and thus, it quickly became clear that the these properties
needed to be replaced by more general and descriptive ones.

\subsubsection{Precise Kinds}

Apart from \emph{path}, all the properties were removed and replaced by two
\emph{labels}: labels are used to group  nodes into subsets; since a node can
belong to more than one subset, it can have more than one label assigned to it.
Implementation of this was straightforward: simply a matter of looking up and
expanding the abstract syntax tree starting from the type
\texttt{global\_reference}.

The two labels are \emph{kind} and \emph{subkind}.  A kind is a string which can
take one of the following values, each directly corresponding to an AST term:
\textsf{module}, \textsf{class}, \textsf{type\_constructor},
\textsf{inductive\_type}, \textsf{definition}, \textsf{assumption} or
\textsf{proof}.

Optionally, some terms have \emph{subkinds}, for distinguishing different
constructs more precisely. For example, when writing Coq, there is no
\texttt{Proof} keyword; instead \texttt{Theorem}, \texttt{Lemma}, \texttt{Fact},
\texttt{Remark}, \texttt{Property}, \texttt{Proposition} and \texttt{Corollary}
all are \emph{synonyms} for proofs. Full details can be found in
Appendix~\ref{chapter:fullmodel}.

\subsubsection{Recursive Modules}

What remained from the initial model was the \emph{path} property. The issue
here was that an inherently \emph{hierarchical} structure (of inclusion) was
represented \emph{flatly} as a string. This made modules second-class citizens,
not subject to the same analyses and manipulations as proof-objects, excluding
the possibility of expressing \emph{module-level dependencies} (as possible
in the coqdep tool).

Adding modules as 

Intention, execution, problems (remember the stack overflow), solutions.

\subsubsection{Types}

\subsubsection{Relationships}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Tried and \emph{removed} x\_USED\_BY\_y
  \item USES
  \item CONTAINS
  \item CONSTRUCTED\_BY
  \item Emphasis on direction of arrow for exploration, importance of consistency
\end{itemize}
