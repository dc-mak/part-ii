\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{chapter:evaluation}

This is where Assessors will be looking for signs of success and for evidence
of thorough and systematic testing. Sample output, tables of timings and
photographs of workstation screens, oscilloscope traces or circuit boards may
be included. 

As with code, voluminous examples of sample output are usually best left to
appendices or omitted altogether. 

There are some obvious questions which this chapter will address. How many of
the original goals were achieved? Were they proved to have been achieved? Did
the program, hardware, or theory really work? 

Assessors are well aware that large programs will very likely include some
residual bugs. It should always be possible to demonstrate that a program works
in simple cases and it is instructive to demonstrate how close it is to working
in a really ambitious case.
